I'm still a little confused on when and how to use accessors and manipulators. I know the general uses, but in the practical sense, I'm still hazy on the concept. I liked this assignment because there were small clear tasks I needed to acomplish to build a train. I was able to finish the engine and the car classes, but wasn't sure on how the passenger class really operated. It didn't feel distinguisable compared to the Car class.
